Sereal plus 130K free coins mod unlock all Hacks full version - Thrix is where things start to get tricky. Firstly, this magical creature is much wider than any opponent you have encountered so far. Although its Gnaw attack causes an average of 2 damage points, it does not have charging time, so Thrix can send spam before you die. Although the little fairy likes to play with the victim, he doesn't really like being beaten. When retreated to a corner, the little fairy will start to panic, emitting a prism attack every 2 turns, causing considerable damage. Once he starts attacking, you need to quickly complete the battle because it's difficult to maintain yourself in the face of his constant attacks. Sereal plus free episodes guide
